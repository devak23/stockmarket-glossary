### OFS
Offer for sale is a process in which the promoters (owners) of the company sell their shares to the general public. In an IPO a private company sells shares to outside investors for additional funding. However, the company's financial problems do not end with an IPO. Sometimes it needs more capital to meet its goals. Thats the time companies can resort to OFS. The chief advantage is the process is simple and essentially a bidding and the investors are generally occurred a discount on the floor price when they buy shares through OFS. The discount is around a range of 5% in these offerings.


### AUM
Assets Under Management is a crucial indicator when evaluating Mutual Funds (MF). The AUM refers to total market value of the assets that a MF manages at a given point in time. MF with a hefty AUM indicates large client base implying a high trust factor on the fund. AUM can also be used to measure the liquidity. A higher AUM provides cushion in case if there is a big redemption. This is especially true for overnight and liquid funds that are sensitive to large redemptions by institutional investors. A large AUM cannot impact returns. The performance of a fund depends on the fund manager and their investment abilities.


### SOP
Stock option plan is an award that gives you the opportunity to purchase a certain number of shares of your comapany's stock at a pre-established price (grant price) over a specified timeframe. SOP's are similar to having coupon for your company's common stock.

### EBITDA
The Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) is a measure of the operating profitability of a company. The EBITDA has 2 main advantages: it is very easy to compute and it is a good proxy of the company's operating cash flow. A positive EBITDA means that the company is profitable at an operating level: it sells its products higher than they cost to make. At the opposite, a negative EBITDA means that the company is facing some operational difficulties or that it is poorly managed.

### ROE
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholder's Equity 

The ROE for Infosys is: 28% = US$2.8b ÷ US$9.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every ₹1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn ₹0.28 in profit. At the present moment (Sep 2021), ROE for TCS is 38.1%. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Firstly, Infosys has a significantly high ROE in comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13%. Despite this, Infosys' five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.5%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so.
