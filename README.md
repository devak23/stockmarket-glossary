 AUM - Assets Under Management is a crucial indicator when evaluating Mutual Funds (MF). The AUM refers to total market value of the assets that a MF manages at a given point in time. MF with a hefty AUM indicates large client base implying a high trust factor on the fund. AUM can also be used to measure the liquidity. A higher AUM provides cushion in case if there is a big redemption. This is especially true for overnight and liquid funds that are sensitive to large redemptions by institutional investors. A large AUM cannot impact returns. The performance of a fund depends on the fund manager and their investment abilities.
