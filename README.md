### OFS
Offer for sale is a process in which the promoters (owners) of the company sell their shares to the general public. In an IPO a private company sells shares to outside investors for additional funding. However, the company's financial problems do not end with an IPO. Sometimes it needs more capital to meet its goals. Thats the time companies can resort to OFS. The chief advantage is the process is simple and essentially a bidding and the investors are generally occurred a discount on the floor price when they buy shares through OFS. The discount is around a range of 5% in these offerings.


### AUM
Assets Under Management is a crucial indicator when evaluating Mutual Funds (MF). The AUM refers to total market value of the assets that a MF manages at a given point in time. MF with a hefty AUM indicates large client base implying a high trust factor on the fund. AUM can also be used to measure the liquidity. A higher AUM provides cushion in case if there is a big redemption. This is especially true for overnight and liquid funds that are sensitive to large redemptions by institutional investors. A large AUM cannot impact returns. The performance of a fund depends on the fund manager and their investment abilities.


### SOP
Stock option plan is an award that gives you the opportunity to purchase a certain number of shares of your comapany's stock at a pre-established price (grant price) over a specified timeframe. SOP's are similar to having coupon for your company's common stock.

### EBITDA
The Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) is a measure of the operating profitability of a company. The EBITDA has 2 main advantages: it is very easy to compute and it is a good proxy of the company's operating cash flow. A positive EBITDA means that the company is profitable at an operating level: it sells its products higher than they cost to make. At the opposite, a negative EBITDA means that the company is facing some operational difficulties or that it is poorly managed.

### ROE
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholder's Equity 

The ROE for Infosys is: 28% = US$2.8b ÷ US$9.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every ₹1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn ₹0.28 in profit. At the present moment (Sep 2021), ROE for TCS is 38.1%. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Firstly, Infosys has a significantly high ROE in comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13%. Despite this, Infosys' five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.5%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so.

### EBIT & PBIT
Earnings Before Interests and Taxes is a measure of a firm’s net income before interest and tax expenses. he larger a company’s EBIT value, the more profitable the company is likely to be. EBIT is calculated by subtracting expenses, usually the cost of goods sold, as well as selling and administrative expenses, from revenues.

Profit Before Interests and Taxes on the other hand on the other hand, is the money left after all expenses are paid. Most businesses use their revenue to pay their expenses; the remainder after all incurred manufacturing or delivery costs is the profit. PBIT measures an enterprise’s profitability by subtracting operating expenses from profit, while excluding tax and interest costs.

EBIT = Operating revenue – cost of goods sold – operating expenses
PBIT = Net profit + interest + taxes

### Right's issue
Right issue is one way through which companies raise additional capital. It is an offer by a company to its existing shareholders to buy additional shares of the firm at a discounted price. It provides the shareholders a chance to increase their holdings in the firm. However, it is not mandatory for the shareholders to participate in a rights issue. They can choose to exercise the option of not buying any extra shares. The rights issues are also used by companies to raise funds by offering a number of shares at a price lower than the current market price for a certain period of time.

 Recently, the telecom major Bharti Airtel came out with a ₹21,000 crore rights issue which would open on October 5. This fundraising is mainly to take on by its rivals in the telecom market. The issue size is 39.22 crore shares and the price for the rights issue shares will be ₹535 per fully paid-up equity share, including face value of ₹5 and premium of ₹530 per equity share, the press release stated. The stock is currently trading around ₹726 per share on the BSE. As per the release, a shareholder can buy 1 rights issue share for every 14 shares he/she holds as per record date which is set on September 28. All shareholders who own shares of the firm before the ex-date, which is determined by the firm, are eligible for the rights issue shares. 

 When announcing a rgihts issue the company also informs the shareholders regarding a record date. It is the cut-off date set by the company. India follows a T+2 rolling system, which means the ex-date is 2 days before the record date. An investor, if he/she wants to be eligible for the bonus issue must buy shares before the ex date. any one who buys the stock on the ex-date will not be eligible for this.
