### Risk and Return

## Definitions
- The return and risk of an asset are commonly measured in terms of the mean and standard deviation (SD).
- The total return represents income + capital gains or losses
- The mean is the return one expects to obtain on an average
- The SD is a measure of the volatility of a return. Its commonly associated to the risk of an asset

## Why SD = Risk ?
- SD is a measure of how much an investment fluctuates from its expected return
- When a price moves widly, SD is high
- Low fluctuations in price generally signals low SD.
Thus SD helps determine the market volatility or the spread of asset price from their average price thereby serving as a good proxy to for "risk". So low fluctuations signal low risk and high fluctuations signal high risk.

## Relation between Return and SD
For a Bell Shape distribution curve signifying the return, one will actually experience price fall within one SD either side of the mean about 68% of the times. Within 2 SD's 95% of the time and with 3 SD's 99.7% of the time

## Historical Returns Vs Future Returns
The mean and SD of a return for a given asset can be computed from historical returns. In that case, however, they are merely "summary descriptors" of the past performance and may or may not relfect the probability distribution of future returns.
Investors ofcourse need to estimate the mean and SD of the future returns (which is impossible in practise unless you are Dr. Strange). This is one of the main limitations of Markowitz portfolio theory.

## Asset Comparison
Assets can be compared on the basis of their means and standard deviation by drawing a simple diagram as shown below.

The X represents the returns (mean) and Y represents the risk (standard deviation). 
- Asset A is a risk free asset like a cash/govt bonds
- Asset B has higher mean and higher SD than asset A
- Asset C has higher mean and higher SD than asset B
- Finally asset D has the highest SD but a lower return than B and C.

If you can invest in one of the 4 assets which one would you pick? The ideal choice would be an asset that lies at the top left corner indicating ALL returns and ZERO risk. The right hand bottom corner on the other hand would be the worst of all with NO returns and ALL risk. 
- Thus we can easily rule out asset D since it has lower returns than B and C and higher risk.
- Assets such as D are said to be "dominated" by B and C. In this figure D is the only dominated asset. Dominated assets are relatively easier to remove from consideration.
- Which one is the dominated asset between A,B and C? That requires knowledge of risk.
- A risk neutral investor would prefer C and a risk averse investor would prefer A.
- Asset B is probably best for somone who is not overly risk averse and also not quite risk neutral.
