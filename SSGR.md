## Self sustainable growth rate (SSGR)
Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) is the rate of growth, which a company can achieve from its profits without relying on additional sources like debt or equity dilution. SSGR is one parameter that can help an investor determine, which companies would be able to show debt-free growth in future.

Self Sustainable Growth Rate derives its genesis from the basic outline of a company’s growth story. During its life, a company needs to:

- Sell products in the market
- Generate profits from these sales
- Pay dividends from its profits
- Invest undistributed profits in the company’s assets
- Use these assets to produce sales in the future

A company needs to do these activities year on year for long periods. If the company were able to do it successfully, then it would generate a huge amount of wealth for its shareholders.

The efficiency level of any company on the steps discussed above can be easily assessed by readily available information in the public domain:

- Net Profit Margin (NPM): NPM highlights the ability of the company to generate profits from sales.
- Dividend Payout Ratio (DPR): DPR indicates the share of profits that is distributed as dividends to shareholders. (1-DPR) reflects the share of profits retained by the company for reinvestment in its own operations. 
- Depreciation (Dep): Depreciation indicates the wear & tear of a company’s assets over time. It is an indicator of reduced efficiency of existing assets to produce sales as these assets become older.
- Net Fixed Assets Turnover (NFAT): NFAT provides the sales generation ability of a company from its net fixed assets. (net fixed assets = gross fixed assets – depreciation)

If an investor analyses the combined effect the four parameters discussed above, then she would be able to arrive at the expected growth rate of a company by utilizing only the retained profits. This expected growth rate is Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR).

    SSGR = NFAT * NPM * (1-DPR) – Dep

If a company is growing at a rate equal to or less than the SSGR and it is able to convert its profits into cash flow from operations, then it would be able to fund its growth from its internal resources without the need of external sources of funds.Conversely, if any company attempts to grow its sales at a rate higher than its SSGR, then its internal resources would not be sufficient to fund its growth aspirations. As a result, the company would have to rely on additional sources of funds like debt or equity dilution to meet the cash requirements to generate its target growth.

Lets explore some cases surrounding SSGR

## [Case A] If SSGR is more than the sales growth of the company.

It indicates that the company has the ability to generate cash in excess of the requirement to sustain its current growth rate. Such companies usually keep on accumulating cash, can afford to give high dividends without impacting prospects of future growth or can increase their growth rate in future without straining their capital structure.

Finolex Cables:

Finolex Cables Ltd is a manufacturer of cables, fans, switches etc. The company specializes in electrical, power distribution and communication optical fibre cables.

The company has an SSGR of 50-60% whereas it has grown its sales at a rate of 3-4% over the years.

The company is growing at a growth rate, which is lower than its SSGR. Therefore, it can easily support its growth without relying on additional debt or equity. Therefore, an investor may notice that over the last 10 years, Finolex Cables Ltd has repaid almost its entire debt of ₹260 cr and is currently nearly debt-free.

## [Case B] If SSGR is less than the sales growth shown by the company in the past:

Such a situation will indicate that the company’s business model does not have the inherent strength to sustain the growth rate it is trying to achieve. The company would continuously need to supplement its profits by bringing in additional cash from equity infusion or debt, to fund its growth aspirations. Most of such companies rely primarily on debt to meet the requirement of additional cash and thereby see high levels of debt on their balance sheets.

ex: Rain Industries Ltd

Rain Industries Ltd is the world’s second-largest manufacturer of calcined pet coke (CPC) and coal tar pitch (CTP) used primarily in aluminium production.

![alt text](https://github.com/devak23/stockmarket-glossary/blob/main/images/Rain-Industries-SSGR.png?raw=true)


Rain Industries Ltd has been growing its sales at a rate higher than its SSGR. As a result, the business profits of the company are not able to sustain its growth aspirations. Therefore, Rain Industries Ltd has relied on debt to meet its growth requirements. Thus, the total debt of the company has increased from ₹3,178 cr in FY2010 to ₹7,845 cr in FY2019.


## [Case C] Companies that have SSGR less than the current growth rate but still manage to reduce debt over the years.

Ideally, companies with Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) less than the current growth rate are expected to see high debt levels as seen in the above discussion. It is with the assumption that such companies do not generate sufficient funds from their profits to meet the requirements of growth. However, an investor would come across companies where despite low Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR), the companies have reduced their debt levels.

In most of these companies, the investor would find that a combination of the following factors:

- Companies improve their operating efficiencies as seen by inventory turnover ratio and receivables days over the years. It restricts the consumption of money in working capital when the business grows.
- Companies report significantly high CFO than PAT over the last 10 years due to high depreciation, which makes CFO higher than PAT. This factor works in conjunction with the improving operating efficiencies discussed in the previous point.
- Companies may have sold their assets to generate cash to repay debt. Funds raised from sales of the assets would appear as positive cash from CFI (cash flow from investing activities).

ex: Heidelberg Cement

![alt text](https://github.com/devak23/stockmarket-glossary/blob/main/images/Heidelberg-Cement-SSGR.png?raw=true)


One can notice that despite an SSGR lower than the sales growth rate, the company has reduced its debt from FY2011 (₹777 cr) to FY2020 (₹413 cr). When financials of Heidelberg Cement India Ltd are analyzed in further depth, then following factors are seen that have contributed to the reduction of debt.

- Improvement in the operating efficiency as seen from the improvement in the inventory turnover ratio (ITR) and receivables days over the years. The ITR of the company increased from 6 in FY2012 to 14 in FY2020. The receivables days improved from 10 days in FY2012 to 4 days in FY2020. Such an improvement in the operating efficiency ratios ensures that a limited amount of money is consumed by working capital as the business grows.
- The improving efficiency along with a high amount of depreciation, ₹792 cr over FY2011-2020 has ensured that the company had a high CFO than its PAT over the last 10-years. During FY2011-2020, the company had a CFO of ₹2,305 cr against a PAT of ₹812 cr. A CFO has helped the company report a free cash flow of ₹1,237 cr. after meeting a capital expenditure of ₹1,068 cr over the last 10 years (FY2011-2020). The free cash flow has helped the company reduce its debt from FY2011 (₹777 cr) to FY2020 (₹413 cr) and increase the cash & investments from ₹311 cr in FY2011 to ₹471 cr in FY2020.


## [Case D] If SSGR is similar to the current growth rate of the company.

In such companies, the investor needs to see whether the entire profits are available for fixed asset creation or are being stuck in working capital. A simple test to find this out is by comparing the cumulative net profit after tax (cPAT) of the last 10 years with the cash flow from operations (cCFO) over the same period.

If cCFO, which factors in changes in the working capital, were significantly less than cPAT, then it would indicate that the company would not be able to maintain its current growth rate without raising additional funds and the company would need to raise additional cash by either equity or debt to fund its increased working capital needs along with growth.

On the contrary, if the company has its cCFO higher than its cPAT, then it means that the working capital position of the company is under control. As a result, the business profits generated by the company are available for the company to fund its growth. In such a case, it is highly probable that the company would be able to meet its growth requirements from its core business and may even reduce its debt over time by repaying some of its debt.


ex: Supreme Industries Ltd

Supreme Industries Ltd is a plastic goods manufacturer in India. The company manufactures plastic pipes, plastic furniture, cross-laminated films, protective packaging, composite LPG cylinders etc.

![alt text](https://github.com/devak23/stockmarket-glossary/blob/main/images/Supreme-Industries-SSGR.png?raw=true)


As mentioned above, in such a case where SSGR and the sales growth are similar, then the investor should compare the cumulative profit after tax (cPAT) and cumulative cash flow from operations (cCFO) for the last 10 years to check if the business profits are available to the company as cash flow.

In the case of Supreme Industries Ltd, an investor notices that the company has cCFO of ₹4,215 cr over FY2011-2020, which is higher than its cPAT of ₹3,333 cr over the same period. It means that the working capital position of the company is under control and the business profits of the company are available with the company for meeting its growth requirements.

Therefore, an investor notices that Supreme Industries Ltd could grow at 7-9% over the last 10 years and also reduce its debt from ₹514 cr in FY2011 to ₹441 cr in FY2020.


## Conclusion

We can see that the companies, which have high Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR), are able to grow in a debt-free manner and provide good wealth creation opportunities for shareholders.

High Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) is dependent upon the below factors:

- High net profit margins (NPM)
- Low dividend payout ratio (DPR)
- Low depreciation (Dep)
- High net fixed asset turnover (NFAT)

Therefore, a company that currently has low Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR), can improve its SSGR by:

- Improving its profitability (NPM) so that it generates higher funds by profits
- Reducing dividend payouts so that most of the profits are reinvested in the company’s operations
- Increase net fixed asset turnover (NFAT) by using better technology & processes so that it can produce more sales from the same amount of fixed assets.
- I believe that an investor should invest in companies, which have nil or very low debt on their books. Such companies are easy to find by filtering all the stocks on debt to equity parameter. However, the ideal investments are the stocks, which can remain debt-free when they grow in future. The investor can find such stocks by analyzing the Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) during detailed analysis.


## Should we reject companies with debt straightaway?

From the above discussion, an investor would notice that debt-free companies i.e. those with nil debt come across as the ones with a good and stable financial position. However, it does not mean that an investor should reject any company, which has debt on its books straightaway even if other parameters show that it has a fundamentally sound business model. The answer is, No!

This is because when an investor studies the history of business growth of companies, then she may notice that the company has taken debt to expand its business. It might have taken debt not because its existing business operations are running into losses or it is not able to convert its profits into cash flow from operations. However, it might have taken additional debt as it came across good business opportunities before its existing operations could repay its existing debt.

Many times, a large capex may be a result of excellent investment opportunities available for the company in its business. As a result, the company may be striving to grow its business fast to capitalize on the available opportunities.

In our attempt to analyse all the companies listed on India stock exchanges, when we looked at the financial performance of more than 2,800 companies above a market capitalization of ₹10 cr, then we came across many companies which had grown their business significantly and as a result, at times, they invested more than what they produced by their cash flow from operations. As a result, they had a negative free cash flow. However, at the same time, these companies rewarded their shareholders by the way of a significant increase in their share price because they kept the debt levels within control and improved their business strength.
