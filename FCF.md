## Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free cash flow (FCF) is the ultimate measure of investability of any company. It is calculated as the surplus cash with the company after meeting its capital expenditure requirements. 

    FCF = CFO – Capex

Where
- CFO = cash flow from operations
- Capex = capital expenditure including maintenance capex and capital work in progress (CWIP)

Capex for any year can be calculated as the difference between gross fixed assets (GFA) & CWIP at the start of the year and the end of the year. It can also be calculated by deducting net fixed assets & CWIP at the start of the year from the net fixed assets & CWIP at end of the year and adding back the depreciation for the year. 

Capex:

    (GFA + CWIP) at the end of the year – (GFA + CWIP) at the start of the year

OR

    (NFA + CWIP) at the end of the year – (NFA + CWIP) at the start of the year + Depreciation for the year

Free cash flow (FCF) is the most essential feature of any business as it amounts to the surplus/discretionary cash that the business/company is able to generate for its shareholders. FCF is the equivalent of savings for a household.

If a company does not have positive free cash flow, it means that it is spending beyond its means. Such a company would have to raise funds from additional sources like debt or equity dilution to meet its requirements. These funds, if raised from debt, would decrease profitability by interest expense and increase bankruptcy risk and if raised from equity, would lead to dilution of the stake of existing shareholders.

It might be argued that the investments done today by the company would lead to revenue & profits in the future and would generate wealth for the shareholders.

The investment in plants & machinery and technology is like an educational loan, which increases future earnings potential. Therefore, we should not worry about the situation where a company is not able to generate positive FCF for a few years. Such companies might be taking education loans to generate future wealth. However, if a company is not able to generate positive FCF over long periods of time (I assess them over the last 10 years), then the company resembles a continuous cash guzzling machine.

The companies, which have achieved their sales growth in the past by using the minimum amount of CFO as capex have a significantly higher margin of safety over the companies which have used almost all CFO. Needless to say, the companies, which have their capex much higher than their entire CFO over the last 10 years (i.e. negative FCF), have very low/negative margin of safety.

## Margin of Safety

Margin of safety, as the name suggests, refers to the comfort level or the cushion that the investor has in a stock when he buys the stock at a particular price. 

A stock's intrinsic value is a function of a variety of factors. There are financial factors like growth in sales, growth in profits, operating margins, P/E ratio, dividend yield etc. Then there are non-financial factors like the management quality, entry barriers created by the product, corporate governance standards, brands and other intangible assets of the company. The final valuation is arrived at by combining the impact of financial and non-financial factors.  It is normally arrived at by discounting future cash flows and then adjusting it with the peer group P/E ratio and other qualitative factors. The output is the intrinsic value of the stock.

A stock is said to be underpriced if the market price is below the intrinsic value and it is considered to be overpriced if the market price is above the intrinsic value. But the big question is by how much is the stock overpriced or underpriced. This gap between the market price and the intrinsic value is referred to as the margin of safety. From an investor’s point of view, if the market price is substantially lower than the intrinsic value of the stock then the stock offers a high margin of safety and it is a good stock available for investment at an attractive level.

Graham in his book “The Intelligent Investor”, first published in 1949, advised investors to compare earnings yield of a stock to the yield on the bonds (Government Securities in India) to arrive at the margin of safety.

In addition to Graham, Dr. Vijay has found out 2 more parameters that will serve as a good indicator for Margin of Safety:

### A) Margin of Safety in the purchase price: 
Earnings Yield (EY) is calculated as the inverse of Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio i.e. E/P ratio. It is calculated by dividing the earnings per share (EPS) with the current market price (CMP).

EY provides an idea about the earning/returns that the stock would produce for every INR invested by the buyer in it.

Earnings Yield being higher than 10 years bond (Government Securities) yield. RBI (https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_NSDPDisplay.aspx?param=4) shows us what the G-sec rate is for 2021

As you can see the rate for 2021 is 6.4%. So any company whose earnings yield is more than 6.4% as of now would be good as per Graham. The higher the difference between EY and G-Sec/Treasury yield at the time of purchase of the stock, the higher is the cushion in times of adversity i.e. higher Margin of Safety. Therefore, the stocks with higher earnings yield (EY) i.e. the ones with low P/E ratio, would provide a higher cushion to the investor during tough times.

The above argument makes me choose my stock at a low P/E ratio as these stocks provide a margin of safety. However, it remains critical to differentiate fundamentally sound companies available at low P/E ratio from the troubled companies, which form the junkyard of stock markets.

### B) Margin of Safety in the business of the company:
- Self Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) being higher than current sales growth

Self-Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) is a measure of the growth potential inherent in the business model of a company, which it can achieve using resources generated through its current profits without relying on external sources of funds like debt or equity dilution.

Self-Sustainable Growth Rate (SSGR) utilizes the features of a company’s business model like net profit margin (NPM), dividend payout ratio (DPR), depreciation (Dep) and net fixed asset turnover (NFAT) to arrive at the sales growth rate that the company can achieve without leveraging itself.

The companies with higher profitability (NPM), operating efficiency (high NFAT) and lower dividend payouts (DPR) would have higher self-sustainable growth rate (SSGR).

An investor should compare the SSGR of the company with its current sales growth to see if there is any margin of safety in the business of model of the company. 

- If the SSGR is higher than the current sales growth rate, it means that the company’s business features (NPM, NFAT & DPR) allow it to grow its sales at a higher rate than the current growth rate. In the case of an economic downturn, the company can safely:

    - reduce its profitability to generate higher demand
    - reduce dividends to conserve funds to make additional investments and
    - invest in fixed assets to improve its plant & machinery/technology (leading to lower NFAT) in an attempt to maintain its current sales growth rate.

    All the above steps would provide funds from business activities and the company would not have to rely on external sources like debt or equity dilution to get funds to maintain its current growth rate.

    Therefore, the company with higher SSGR can increase their sales growth rate in normal times and maintain current sales growth rate during tough times without leveraging their balance sheet by taking on debt

- If the SSGR less than current sales growth rate, the investor would notice that such companies are already growing more than their business potential. Such companies usually rely on raising debt or diluting their equity to generate funds needed for investments to generate sales growth.

    These companies had to consistently raise debt/dilute equity to raise funds for investments to generate growth, as their operational business was not able to generate the required amount of funds.

- If the SSGR is equal to current sales growth rate,

- Positive Free Cash Flow (FCF) after meeting entire capex
