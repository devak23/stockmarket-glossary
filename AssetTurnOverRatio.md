# Asset Turn Over Ratio

Asset turnover ratio represents the efficiency with which a company is able to use investments in its assets. It is defined as a ratio of sales and assets. Effectively, an asset turnover ratio intimates an investor the amount of sales that a company can generate from an investment of ₹1 in its assets.


A company with a high asset turnover indicates can generate a higher amount of sales from the same investment in its assets than a company with low asset turnover. 

Asset turnover is also a representative of capital-intensiveness of the business of the company. It means that the companies with a low asset turnover would need to invest a higher amount of money in their assets to generate sales. Whereas the companies with a higher asset turnover would need to invest a lower amount of money in their assets to generate sales. 

However, apart from a simple interpretation of the amount of investment needed to generate sales, an investor should focus on other secondary consequences of asset turnover (capital intensiveness). These secondary consequences primarily relate to the nature of competition that the company would face due to the ease or the difficulty of competitors to enter the business depending on the amount of capital needed to start and run the business.


Another important consequence of asset turnover is the continuous requirement by the business for additional capital for growth. This is an especially critical parameter for companies that have a low asset turnover and as a result, are highly capital intensive. When asset turnover is above a certain level, then the business becomes highly competitive. Moreover, if the asset turnover is lower, then the company faces the risk of entering a debt-trap and a possibility of bankruptcy.


## Different types of asset turnover ratios
Most common of these asset turnover ratios are:

- Total asset turnover ratio
- Fixed asset turnover ratio and
- Net fixed asset turnover ratio (NFAT)

We prefer to use Net Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio in our analysis because it indicates the usage pattern of operative productive assets like plants and machinery after factoring in the wear & tear (depreciation) and excludes assets held in form of investments in third parties, cash etc.

We calculate Net Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio (NFAT) as:

NFAT = Sales / Average of Net fixed assets at the start of the year and at the end of the year

In their analysis, an investor would come across companies having a wide range of net fixed asset turnover. They would find companies with net fixed asset turnover of less than one as well as more than 10. A Net Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio of 1 indicates that every incremental investment of ₹1 by a company in its plants and machinery would increase its sales by ₹1.

Let us first discuss how net fixed asset turnover influences the competitive intensity of any company.

## High Net Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio increases competition from unorganized sector
Typically companies that have a high net fixed asset turnover ratio (NFAT), especially with an NFAT of 4 or more suffer from high competition from the unorganized sector. This is because the companies with a net fixed asset turnover ratio of 4 or more have very low capital requirements. Such businesses require a comparatively very low amount of money to start the business and in turn, can generate a significant amount of revenue from the small amount of capital. In most of the cases, the product or service provided by such businesses with a low capital intensity (i.e. high NFAT) is technologically very simple i.e. the technology needed to make the products or provide the services is easily available at a cheaper price. Therefore, in such businesses, a lot of entrepreneurs raise money from their families and friends and start the business and increase the competition for existing players. As most of the times, such businesses do not involve advanced technology, therefore, their customers can easily switch from one supplier to another. In such situations, the key parameter that influences a customer’s purchase decision is the price of the product/service and the manufacturers lose any negotiating/pricing power over the customers. Therefore, in such high net fixed asset turnover businesses, all the companies start competing primarily on price resulting in price wars.

## Low Net Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio may lead to a debt trap
Low net fixed asset turnover ratio represents situations where a company needs to invest a lot of money in the assets to generate its sales. These businesses are highly capital intensive. In most of the cases, they continue to require large additional investments if the company wishes to grow its business.

It has been noticed that usually, the businesses with a net fixed asset turnover ratios of less than 1.50 are highly capital intensive. Such businesses, if not managed properly, have a high risk of leading to debt traps and in turn risk of bankruptcy.

ex: Century Textiles & Industries Ltd


Assume that a company has an average NFAT of 1 and it targets to achieve sales of 1000 Cr. every year. In that case, it has to invest 1000 Cr. in Assets. This 1000 Cr. would produce a profit of 40 Cr. assuming a net profit margin of 40% (Century textiles). If the company decides to keep the profit and invest in its operations, it would need 960 Cr. the second year (as 40 Cr. profit the previous year would result in 40Cr of sales) to keep up with the sales of 1000 Cr every year. This 960 Cr. should now be funded via debt or fresh equity infusion.

Thus, we may see that with a low fixed asset turnover of 1.00 combined with a low net profit margin of 4% results in a situation where the company would have to keep on relying on additional sources of funds to maintain its growth. As a result, it does not come as a surprise to the investor that in the past, the debt of Century Textiles & Industries Ltd has increased from ₹3,112 cr in FY2011 to ₹5,700 cr in FY2017.

# High Net Asset Turnover Ratio should be associated with Intellectual Property
When an investor looks at any company with a high net fixed asset turnover ratio, then she should always try to assess if the company has any intellectual property rights, patents, high technology, brand etc. that may protect it from the intense competition that might arise from unorganized sector.

Case in point HUL. The company has a net fixed asset turnover ratio of 8 and above in the last 10 years (FY2011-2020). However, despite such low capital-intensive business, the company has grown its sales from ₹20,023 cr in FY2011 to ₹39,783 cr in FY2020 and has increased its operating profit margin from 13% in FY2011 to 25% in FY2020.

Such an improvement in the business with increasing sales, improving profit margins and no debt, despite having a high net fixed asset turnover ratio seems counterintuitive to an investor based on the above discussion that a high NFAT indicates low capital needs and in turn, high competition from unorganized sector.

However, it turns out that HUL is enjoying such business performance with low capital investment needs because it has created strong barriers against the competition in the form of well-known and established brands in almost all its product segments. In addition, HUL has created a strong product distribution channel across the length and breadth of the country that makes its products available even in the remote areas.

As a result, HUL enjoys strong business performance despite low capital investment needs in the business i.e. high net fixed asset turnover.

HUL represents a case where a company could protect itself from the unorganized sector despite low capital investment needs (high net fixed asset turnover ratio) of the business by creating strong brands and distribution channel.
